## EXERCISE 1: Working with Lists
Using the following list:

`my_list = [1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 22, 35, 52, 83]`

* Write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are higher than or equal 10.
* Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements higher than or equal 10 from this list in it and print out this new list.
* Ask the user for a number as input and print a list that contains only those elements from my_list that are higher than the number given by the user.
